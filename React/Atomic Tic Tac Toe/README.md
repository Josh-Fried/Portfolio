### How To Play 

### Rules: 

Atomic Tic Tac Toe is a variation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a twist. 

Atomic Tic Tac Toe is played on a big 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board and each cell of the big 3x3 board contains a smaller 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board. The goal of the game is to win the bigger Tic Tac Toe board by winning three smaller Tic Tac Toe boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). 

The game starts by Player X choosing one of the 9 smaller boards and then placing an "X" in one of the cells of the smaller board they chose. Based on the cell that Player X chose, the game will move to that coresponding smaller board. Player O will then place their "O" in one of the cells of the smaller board. Player X and Player O continue this cycle until a player wins a smaller board. A Player can win a board by getting three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). When a player wins a smaller board that cell of the bigger board becomes an "X" or "O". If a player then plays in a coresponding cell in a smaller board to a won cell in the big board then the player will get to chose a smaller board and get to play their turn in that board.
