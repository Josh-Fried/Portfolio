### How It Works

The user enters `go run wordscape.go` into the command line. My program will then prompt the use to enter the letters.

After the user enters the letters the program will output the answers. It finds the answers by using a combination of all the letters for 3, 4, 5 and 6 letter words from a word list of over 43000 words.

### How To Play 

### Rules: 
Wordscapes has many levels and a level is won by finding all the possible words that can be made from a combination of letters. 

A level looks like:

My program looks like this:

The level was completed only using the words from my program. My program can solve any Wordscapes level and comes up with the answers in under a second.
